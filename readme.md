Store Japanese words in `tsv` file.

As I came across Japanese words, I wanted to note down those words and to be able to look it up later. A simple way is to store them in text file (a `tsv` file to be able to store relevant information with that word). However, I had to indent every columns and the whole `tsv` file was too large to focus on the information that I want to get.
